# ChatRoom
##### A ChatRoom Built with React.js 

* Material-ui for ui component.
* Flux（Alt）for state management.
* webpack and react-hot-loader provided a great development experience.
* use babel to transpile JSX and ES6

The ChatRoom used `Firebase` real-time database , Firebase helps me building a real-time web applications without dealing with the complexity of back-end service，in addition it offers an authentication process.In this App, users can login in with their Google accounts.
